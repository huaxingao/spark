Set operators are used to combine the results of two queries into a single result. Spark SQL supports three types of set operators:
- `EXCEPT` and `EXCEPT ALL`
- `INTERSECT` and `INTERSECT ALL`
- `UNION` and `UNION ALL`

Note that the queries' result sets must have the same number of columns and compatible data types for the respective columns.

### EXCEPT and EXCEPT ALL
`EXCEPT` and `EXCEPT ALL` return the rows that are found in one query but not the other query. `EXCEPT` takes only distinct rows while `EXCEPT ALL` does not remove duplicates.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
[ ( ] query [ ) ] EXCEPT [ ALL ] [ ( ] query[ ) ]
{% endhighlight %}

### INTERSECT and INTERSECT ALL
`INTERSECT` and `INTERSECT ALL` return the rows that are found in both queries. `INTERSECT` takes only distinct rows while `INTERSECT ALL` does not remove duplicates.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
[ ( ] query [ ) ] INTERSECT [ ALL ] [ ( ] query [ ) ]
{% endhighlight %}

### UNION and UNION ALL
`UNION` and `UNION ALL` return the rows that are found in either query. `UNION` takes only distinct rows while `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicates.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
[ ( ] query [ ) ] UNION [ ALL ] [ ( ] query [ ) ]
{% endhighlight %}

### Examples

-- Use number1 and number2 tables to demonstrate set operators.

SELECT * FROM number2;

|  5|

|  2|
|  2|
+---+

SELECT C from number1 EXCEPT SELECT C FROM number2;
+---+

SELECT C from number1 EXCEPT ALL (SELECT C FROM number2);
